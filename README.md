# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-For-Language-Translation
Developed simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) code to use Google Translate API to translate different languages out of sheer curiosity only. 

# Instructions To Run Program
Wrote my code using Google Collab. Just need to change the following parameters for the language translation:
```
  1. Change the text that you would like to translate
  2. Select your target language under target_lang
```
